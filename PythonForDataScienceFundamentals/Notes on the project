Notes for improvement on the project:

1. Why choose to filter the Google Play duplicates based on ratings count and not installs? Would there be a difference

2. Why choose "Category" over "Genres" when assessing the average number of installs per app in each genre for the Google Play dataset? What would the difference be in the results?

3. Could also look at including content ratings in the analysis

4. If in-app purchases are a source of revenue, maybe we should consider rating values as well, and not just counts
